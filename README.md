## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on front end topics

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS 
* Dictionary (for all of the keys)
* Array Manipulation methods (splice, iteration, )
* HowlJS (sounds)
* PaperJS (animations & effects)

## Challenges

* Found out the hard way that Paper.js is only es5 compatible
* Refresher on array manipulation methods and vanilla JS as I have been using ES6+ with React/Redux

## Next Steps

* Using more animation in my future projects
